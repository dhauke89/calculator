# Calculator

This project is a simple calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created as a learning exercise to practice fundamental web development concepts.

## Features

* Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
* Error handling for invalid input and division by zero
* Clear entry and clear all functionality

## Implementation Details

* The calculator's logic is implemented primarily using JavaScript functions and event listeners.
* The display is updated dynamically using DOM manipulation.
* The code includes error handling to prevent invalid calculations and display appropriate messages to the user.

## Future Enhancements

* Keyboard support
* Memory functions
* More advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation)
* Refactoring to utilize object-oriented programming principles for improved code organization and maintainability.
